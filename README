Nissan Consult Arduino Library v1.0
June 12th 2011

A library for interfacing your Arduino to a Nissan Consult port
using a serial consult adapter.  You can buy these Serial adapters
on Ebay or from China for around $15.  You can also build one yourself
following the schematics here: http://www.plmsdevelopments.com/diy_consult.htm

This URL also links to PDFs containing the consult protocol, so feel free to 
extend this code to be able to do considerably more, just make sure you post 
your updated code back to the project!

Portions of this code inspired by Patrick Cole and his consult empeg code
found here: http://www.supremez.com/empeg-consult/
